# Password-Generator 03 Javascript Challenge

This week's Challenge requires me to modify starter code to generate random passwords based on certain criteria.

# Project description

I modified the starter code and including the functions and added multiple arrays. I started with when the button is clicked it calls on my prompts function which return
a new value to randomCharacters after the function is ran. Now after it returns true the newPassword variable calls on generatePassword function. Then my password is set
to an empty string which then I recieve a random numbe for randomIndex then I add them together to return a value that will be my newPassword and will write to the
textarea box.
