## User-Sory

As an employee with a very busy schedule I want to add important events/meetings to a daily planner. Doing so will make me more efficient at my job and become a better
employee by helping me manage my time better.

## Project description

I modified the starter code and including the functions and added multiple arrays. I started with when the button is clicked it calls on my prompts function which return
a new value to randomCharacters after the function is ran. Now after it returns true the newPassword variable calls on generatePassword function. Then my password is set
to an empty string which then I recieve a random numbe for randomIndex then I add them together to return a value that will be my newPassword and will write to the
textarea box.
